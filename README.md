BT quirk equipment
==================

This mod adds quirk equipment in the style of the DLCs to some original release
stock mechs with low tonnage in their class, or which are particularly in-
effective for other reasons. As much as was possible, the quirks follow lore
according to the Sarna.net wiki (either official mech quirks, or invented using
the descriptive text).

The design goal is a more interesting and varied battlefield, and to balance
up weak mechs second. So while an attempt is made to give better bonuses to
worse mechs, not all bonuses are as useful for the player as the AI.
